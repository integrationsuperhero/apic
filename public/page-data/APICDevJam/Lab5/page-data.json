There is already a legacy SOAP-based application which will do\nthe calculation, but it should be exposed to consumers as a modern\nRESTful API. In this section, you will create a new OpenAPI definition\nfor the financing API.\n\n1. From the left navigation menu,\n  click `Develop.`\n\n2. Click `Add` and\n  choose `API`.\n\n    ![](images/step1_1.png)\n\n3. Select `New OpenAPI` and click `Next.`\n\n    ![](images/step1_3.png)\n\n4. Fill in the form for **Create New OpenAPI** with the following values: \n\n    `Title: financing`\n\n    **Name: financing**\n\n    **Base Path: /financing**\n\n    **Version: 1.0.0**\n\n    Click **Next**.\n\n    ![](images/step1_4.png)\n\n5.

Create the model definition for the new API. These definitions are\n    used in a few places. Their primary role is to serve as documentation in\n    the developer portal on expected input and output parameters. However,\n    they can also be used for data mapping actions.\n    Click `Definitions` from the API\n    Designer menu on the left. Then,\n    click `Add` to create a new definition.\n\n![](images/step1_7.png)\n\n8. Enter `paymentAmount` for `Name` and\n    leave the definition `Type` set\n    to `object`.\n![](images/step1_8.png)\n\n10.\tClick on the Add+ button to add a new property\n\n![](images/1-10.png)\n\n11.\tFilling in the following values.

The switch editor will open with a single case with case 0 created by default. Next to case 0, click [search operations...] to show the drop-down list of available operations. Select the [shipping.calc] operation.\n\n![](images/6-1-2.png)\n\n\n\n3.\tClick the [Add Case] button to add a second case for the `get.stores` operation.\n\n\n\n4.\tClick [X] to close the operation switch configuration editor and then click `Save`. You should see two new processing pipelines created on your `operation-switch` step - one for each case:\n\n![](images/6-1-4.png)\n\n\n### 2.
